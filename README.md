# Parkinson-Prediction


## Description

The objective of this wok is to predict if a person is affected by the Parkinson's disease or not. Parkinson’s disease is a slow, progressive, and chronic neurodegenerative disorder. It affects the human central nervous system by destroying dopaminergic neurons which produce dopamine.

The disease begins 5 to 10 years before any clinical symptoms appear; at this point, approximately half of the dopaminergic neurons have already disappeared.

For that, We propose a data-driven approach for Parkinson’s disease diagnosis. By analysing the signals measured from 8 different locations under each foot (16 signals in total), we extract the different features that describes well the signals ( mean, coefficient of variations, standard deviation ..) and then we apply and compare different machine learning algorithms.
